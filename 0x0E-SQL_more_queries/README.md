# SQL Project - Advanced Queries and Database Management

## Introduction
Hey, welcome to my SQL Project - Advanced Queries and Database Management. I'm excited to share this project, which is all about taking your SQL skills to the next level. Throughout this journey, we'll explore advanced topics related to database management, query optimization, and the art of designing well-structured databases. By the end of this project, you'll be equipped to handle complex SQL operations like a pro.

## Learning Objectives
Throughout this project, I'm aiming to master several key topics. My goal is to be able to explain these concepts to anyone, even without relying on Google:

### General
#### How to create a new MySQL user
I'll walk you through the process of creating user accounts and granting specific permissions to access databases.

#### How to manage privileges for a user to a database or table
We'll dive into the versatile GRANT statement, which allows you to control access to specific parts of your database.

#### What’s a PRIMARY KEY
We'll explore the essential concept of primary keys and how they ensure each record in your table is unique.

#### What’s a FOREIGN KEY
I'll explain the role of foreign keys, which establish relationships between different tables.

#### How to use NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints
We'll discuss constraints and how using NOT NULL and UNIQUE helps maintain data integrity.

#### How to retrieve data from multiple tables in one request
No more one-table queries. I'll show you how to efficiently combine data from various tables in a single query.

#### What are subqueries
Master the art of nesting one query inside another, enabling advanced data retrieval.

#### What are JOIN and UNION
You'll understand the magic of joining tables and combining data with the UNION operator.
