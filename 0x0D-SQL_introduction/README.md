# 0x0D. SQL - Introduction

## Overview
Welcome to my project! This endeavor revolves around delving into the world of databases, MySQL, and SQL. In the following sections, I'll outline the key concepts, objectives, and resources that form the backbone of this project.

## Learning Objectives
### General
#### What's a database
In this project, I aim to provide a clear understanding of what a database is, its role in data management, and how data is structured within it.

#
### General
#### Editors
For this project, I'll be using vi, vim, or emacs as my preferred text editors.

#### Environment
All files are developed and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, utilizing MySQL 8.0 (version 8.0.25).

#### Formatting
I'll ensure that all project files end with a new line and that SQL queries are properly commented just before their respective statements.

#### Documentation
Each file will start with a task description as a comment to provide context.

#### SQL Keywords
I'll consistently use uppercase letters for SQL keywords (e.g., SELECT, WHERE).

#### README.md
This README.md file serves as the central documentation hub for the project.

#### File Length
I'll make sure that the length of each file adheres to project guidelines using the `wc` command.
